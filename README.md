# Sales Prediction Project

## Overview

This project involves predicting future sales based on historical sales data using machine learning techniques in Python. The project utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to analyze and preprocess data, train a predictive model, and visualize sales trends. The goal is to provide accurate sales predictions, aiding businesses in strategic planning and inventory management.

## Project Structure

- `sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `sales_data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with historical sales data.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for building predictive models.
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization library.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Running the Project
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook sales_prediction.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Make sure to have the sales_data.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
Follow the notebook steps for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

## Sales Prediction Model
A machine learning model is trained on historical sales data to predict future sales.
Evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided to assess the model's performance and understand sales trends.

## Customization
Modify the dataset or experiment with different machine learning algorithms for improved prediction accuracy.
Explore additional features or optimizations to enhance the sales prediction model.
